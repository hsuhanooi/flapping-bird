**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F005 (Create Bird Object) is next - define bird with position, size, and velocity
- The update() function is a placeholder - add bird physics here
- The render() function calls clearCanvas() then drawBackground() - add bird rendering after background
- stopGameLoop() exists for pausing/cleanup but isn't used yet
- Game loop runs automatically when page loads via init()

---

### [2026-01-10] - F005: Create Bird Object
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Created bird object with all required properties:
  - x: 80 (left side of canvas)
  - y: 300 (placeholder, set to CANVAS_HEIGHT / 2 via initBird())
  - width: 34px
  - height: 24px
  - velocity: 0
- Created initBird() function to set bird's initial position (y = CANVAS_HEIGHT / 2)

- Use bird.x, bird.y for position and bird.width, bird.height for dimensions
- bird.velocity will be used in F007 (Implement Gravity) for physics
- resetBird() function is ready for game restart functionality later

---

### [2026-01-10] - F006: Render Bird
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Created renderBird() function that draws bird as a yellow filled rectangle
- Set bird color to #f7dc6f (yellow/gold color)
- Uses ctx.fillRect() with bird.x, bird.y, bird.width, bird.height
- Added renderBird() call in render() function after drawBackground()
- Bird now renders every frame at its current position

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added renderBird() function and integrated it into render()

**Files Created:**
- tests/bird-rendering.test.js - 18 unit tests for bird rendering

**Tests:** 18/18 passing (122 total across all test files)

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F007 (Implement Gravity) is next - add gravity constant and physics to bird
- The renderBird() function is called every frame in the render() function
- Bird is drawn as a simple rectangle for now (will be styled in F040)
- The bird.x and bird.y properties are used directly, so updating them will move the bird
- bird.velocity is ready to be used in physics calculations

---

### [2026-01-10] - F007: Implement Gravity
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Defined GRAVITY constant with value 0.5 (pixels per frame squared)
- Created updateBird() function that implements physics:
  - Adds GRAVITY to bird.velocity each frame (acceleration)
  - Adds bird.velocity to bird.y each frame (position update)
- Updated update() function to call updateBird()
- Bird now falls due to gravity with accelerating velocity

**Physics Behavior:**
- Gravity value of 0.5 provides natural-feeling acceleration
- After 10 frames, velocity reaches 5 pixels/frame
- After 30 frames (~0.5 seconds at 60fps), velocity reaches 15 pixels/frame
- Negative velocity (upward movement) is naturally reduced by gravity
- Gravity will eventually reverse upward velocity to downward

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added GRAVITY constant and updateBird() function, updated update()

**Files Created:**
- tests/gravity.test.js - 19 unit tests for gravity physics

**Tests:** 19/19 passing (141 total across all test files)

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F008 (Add Keyboard Flap Input) is next - add spacebar input to make bird jump
- The updateBird() function is called every frame via update()
- To make bird flap upward, set bird.velocity to a negative value (e.g., -8)
- FLAP_STRENGTH will be defined in F008 for consistent flap power
- Currently the bird will fall infinitely - ground collision comes in F012
- The physics are simple: velocity += gravity, position += velocity

---

### [2026-01-10] - F008: Add Keyboard Flap Input
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Defined FLAP_STRENGTH constant with value -8 (negative for upward movement)
- Created flap() function that sets bird.velocity to FLAP_STRENGTH
- Created handleKeyDown(event) function that:
  - Checks if spacebar is pressed (event.code === 'Space' or event.keyCode === 32)
  - Calls event.preventDefault() to prevent page scroll
  - Calls flap() to make bird jump upward
- Added document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown) to set up keyboard input

**Physics Behavior:**
- FLAP_STRENGTH of -8 provides a strong upward impulse
- After flap, bird immediately starts decelerating due to gravity (0.5 per frame)
- It takes ~16 frames (~0.27 seconds at 60fps) for upward velocity to reach 0
- After that, bird begins falling again with accelerating downward velocity
- Multiple rapid flaps work correctly - each flap resets velocity to -8

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added FLAP_STRENGTH constant, flap(), handleKeyDown(), and event listener

**Files Created:**
- tests/keyboard-input.test.js - 28 unit tests for keyboard flap functionality

**Tests:** 28/28 passing (169 total across all test files)

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F009 (Add Mouse/Click Flap Input) is next - add click handler to canvas
- The flap() function is ready to be reused for mouse/touch input
- handleKeyDown will need modification in F024 (Game State Manager) to handle start/restart states
- Currently the bird can fly infinitely - velocity cap comes in F010
- Currently there's no game over state - bird will fall through bottom of canvas

---

### [2026-01-10] - F009: Add Mouse/Click Flap Input
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Created handleClick(event) function that calls flap() when canvas is clicked
- Added canvas.addEventListener('click', handleClick) to set up mouse click input
- Reused existing flap() function for identical behavior to keyboard input

**Event Handling:**
- Click event listener is attached to canvas element (not document)
- handleClick() simply calls the existing flap() function
- Both click and spacebar trigger identical flap behavior (velocity = -8)
- Multiple rapid clicks work correctly - each click resets velocity to FLAP_STRENGTH

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added handleClick() function and click event listener

**Files Created:**
- tests/mouse-input.test.js - 14 unit tests for mouse/click flap functionality

**Tests:** 14/14 passing (183 total across all test files)

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F010 (Add Velocity Cap) is next - limit maximum upward and downward velocity
- The handleClick() function will need modification in F024 (Game State Manager) to handle start/restart states
- Touch input for mobile comes in F035 (Add Touch Event Listener)
- The click handler is attached to the canvas element specifically to allow clicking anywhere on the game area
- Click events work in conjunction with spacebar - both methods are available

---

### [2026-01-10] - F010: Add Velocity Cap
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Defined MAX_VELOCITY constant with value 10 (terminal velocity for falling)
- Added velocity capping in updateBird() function:
  - After applying gravity, caps downward velocity at MAX_VELOCITY
  - Caps upward velocity at FLAP_STRENGTH (-8) to prevent unrealistic upward speed
- Velocity capping happens after gravity is applied but before position update

**Physics Behavior:**
- Bird cannot fall faster than 10 pixels/frame (terminal velocity)
- Bird cannot fly upward faster than -8 pixels/frame (FLAP_STRENGTH)
- Normal gameplay is unaffected - caps only prevent extreme velocities
- Capping provides a consistent, predictable gameplay feel
- The relationship between MAX_VELOCITY (10) and |FLAP_STRENGTH| (8) ensures balanced gameplay

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added MAX_VELOCITY constant and velocity capping in updateBird()

**Files Created:**
- tests/velocity-cap.test.js - 20 unit tests for velocity cap functionality
**Tests:** 20/20 passing (203 total across all test files)

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F011 is next - Render ground
- The velocity cap prevents the bird from falling infinitely fast or flying impossibly high
- updateBird() order: gravity -> cap velocity -> update position
- Ground/ceiling collision comes in F012/F013 - currently bird can still go off-screen
- All 10 bird core features (F001-F010) are now complete

---

### [2026-01-10] - F011: Render Ground
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Defined GROUND_HEIGHT constant with value 80 (pixels)
- Created renderGround() function that draws ground as a tan/brown filled rectangle
- Ground color set to #deb887 (tan/brown color)
- Ground positioned at bottom of canvas (y = CANVAS_HEIGHT - GROUND_HEIGHT)
- Ground spans full width of canvas (width = CANVAS_WIDTH)
- Added renderGround() call in render() function after renderBird()
- Ground renders every frame at the bottom of the canvas

**Visual Behavior:**
- Ground appears as a 80px tall rectangle at the bottom of the 600px canvas
- Ground starts at y position 520 (600 - 80)
- Ground color (#deb887) is visually distinct from sky background (#70c5ce)
- Ground color is also distinct from bird color (#f7dc6f)

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added GROUND_HEIGHT constant and renderGround() function, integrated into render()

**Files Created:**
- tests/ground-rendering.test.js - 24 unit tests for ground rendering functionality

**Tests:** 24/24 passing (227 total across all test files)

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F012 (Implement Ground Collision) is next - detect when bird hits the ground
- The ground is now visible at the bottom of the canvas
- Ground y position is CANVAS_HEIGHT - GROUND_HEIGHT = 600 - 80 = 520
- Bird will currently fall through the ground - collision detection needed in F012
- The renderGround() function is called every frame in the render() function
- Ground rendering order: background -> bird -> ground (ground on top, which is correct)

---

### [2026-01-10] - F012: Implement Ground Collision
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Created gameOver flag variable initialized to false
- Calculated ground y position (CANVAS_HEIGHT - GROUND_HEIGHT = 600 - 80 = 520)
- Added ground collision detection in updateBird() function:
  - Calculates bird bottom edge (bird.y + bird.height)
  - Checks if birdBottom >= groundY
  - Sets gameOver to true when collision detected
  - Positions bird exactly on ground surface (bird.y = groundY - bird.height)
- Added early return in updateBird() if gameOver is true to stop bird movement
- Reset gameOver flag to false in initBird() function for game reset functionality

**Collision Behavior:**
- Bird stops moving when it hits the ground
- gameOver flag prevents further physics updates
- Bird visually rests on ground surface (positioned at y = 520 - 24 = 496)
- Collision detection runs every frame in updateBird()
- Ground collision triggers game over state

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added gameOver flag, ground collision detection, and movement stopping logic

**Files Created:**
- tests/ground-collision.test.js - 14 unit tests for ground collision functionality

**Tests:** 14/14 passing (241 total across all test files)

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F013 (Implement Ceiling Collision) is next - detect when bird hits the ceiling
- The gameOver flag is now set on ground collision and stops bird movement
- initBird() resets gameOver to false, ready for game restart functionality later
- Bird position is adjusted to rest exactly on ground surface when collision occurs
- The gameOver flag will be used in F028 (Game Over State Behavior) for full game state management

---

### [2026-01-10] - F013: Implement Ceiling Collision
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Added ceiling collision detection in updateBird() function:
  - Checks if bird top edge (bird.y) <= 0
  - Sets gameOver to true when ceiling collision detected
  - Positions bird exactly at top of canvas (bird.y = 0) when collision occurs
- Ceiling collision check is performed before ground collision check
- Bird movement stops when gameOver is true (existing early return handles this)

**Collision Behavior:**
- Bird cannot fly above canvas top (y = 0)
- gameOver flag is set on ceiling collision
- Bird visually rests at top of canvas when collision occurs
- Collision detection runs every frame in updateBird()
- Ceiling collision triggers game over state (same as ground collision)

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added ceiling collision detection in updateBird() function

**Files Created:**
- tests/ceiling-collision.test.js - 13 unit tests for ceiling collision functionality

**Tests:** 13/13 passing (254 total across all test files)

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F014 (Create Pipe Object Structure) is next - define pipe data structure with top and bottom sections
- Both ceiling and ground collision now set gameOver flag and stop bird movement
- Bird is positioned at y=0 when hitting ceiling, similar to ground collision positioning
- The gameOver flag will be used in F028 (Game Over State Behavior) for full game state management
- All boundary collisions (ceiling and ground) are now complete

---

### [2026-01-10] - F014: Create Pipe Object Structure
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Defined PIPE_WIDTH constant with value 52 (pixels)
- Defined PIPE_GAP constant with value 120 (pixels) for space between top and bottom pipes
- Created pipes array initialized as empty array to hold all active pipes
- Defined pipe object structure with properties:
  - x: horizontal position of the pipe (left edge)
  - topHeight: height of the top pipe section (from top of canvas)
  - bottomY: y position where the bottom pipe starts (calculated as topHeight + PIPE_GAP)
- Added documentation comments explaining the pipe structure

**Pipe Structure:**
- Each pipe object represents a pair of pipes (top and bottom) with a gap between them
- The gap is defined by PIPE_GAP (120px) between topHeight and bottomY
- Pipes array will hold multiple pipe objects as they spawn and move across the screen
- Pipe structure allows for easy collision detection and rendering in future features

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added PIPE_WIDTH, PIPE_GAP constants, pipes array, and pipe structure documentation

**Files Created:**

- Uses PIPE_WIDTH (52px) for both pipe sections
- Calculates bottom pipe height from bottomY to ground (CANVAS_HEIGHT - GROUND_HEIGHT)
- Added renderPipes() call in render() function before renderBird() so pipes appear behind bird
- Pipes render every frame when pipes array contains pipe objects

**Visual Behavior:**
- Top and bottom pipes render as green rectangles
- Gap between pipes is visible (defined by PIPE_GAP = 120px)
- Multiple pipes can render simultaneously when pipes array has multiple objects

- The renderPipes() function is ready and will render any pipes in the pipes array
- Currently pipes array is empty - pipes need to be spawned (F017) and moved (F016) to be visible
- Pipe rendering order: background -> pipes -> bird -> ground (correct visual layering)
- The green color (#228B22) is a classic Flappy Bird pipe color

---

### [2026-01-10] - F016: Implement Pipe Movement
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Defined PIPE_SPEED constant with value 2 (pixels per frame)
- Created updatePipes() function that moves pipes from right to left:
  - Loops through all pipes in the pipes array
  - Subtracts PIPE_SPEED from each pipe's x position each frame
  - Returns early if gameOver is true (pipes stop moving on game over)
- Added updatePipes() call in update() function after updateBird()
- Pipes now move smoothly from right to left when pipes are added to the array

**Movement Behavior:**
- Pipes move at constant speed of 2 pixels per frame
- At 60fps, pipes move 120 pixels per second
- Movement is consistent and smooth
- Pipes stop moving when gameOver flag is set to true
- Multiple pipes can move simultaneously

- The PIPE_SPEED constant (2px/frame) provides smooth, consistent movement

---

### [2026-01-10] - F017: Spawn New Pipes
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Defined PIPE_SPAWN_INTERVAL constant with value 90 (frames between pipe spawns)
- Created frameCount variable initialized to 0 to track game frames
- Created spawnPipe() function that:
  - Calculates groundY position (CANVAS_HEIGHT - GROUND_HEIGHT)
  - Generates random topHeight between 50 and (groundY - PIPE_GAP - 50)
  - Calculates bottomY from topHeight + PIPE_GAP
  - Creates new pipe object with x = CANVAS_WIDTH (right edge of canvas)
  - Adds pipe to pipes array using pipes.push()
- Modified updatePipes() function to call spawnPipe() when frameCount % PIPE_SPAWN_INTERVAL === 0
- Modified update() function to increment frameCount each frame
- Modified initBird() function to reset frameCount to 0 for game reset functionality

**Pipe Spawning Behavior:**
- New pipes spawn every 90 frames (1.5 seconds at 60fps)
- Pipe gap position varies randomly between 50px from top and 50px from ground
- Pipes start at right edge of canvas (x = 400) and move left
- Random topHeight ensures varied gameplay with safe gap positions
- frameCount tracks game progression for consistent spawning intervals

**Files Modified:**

### [2026-01-10] - F018: Remove Off-Screen Pipes
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Added pipe removal logic in updatePipes() function
- Checks if pipe right edge (x + PIPE_WIDTH) is off-screen (< 0)
- Uses reverse loop (from end to start) with splice() to safely remove pipes
- Removes pipes after movement update but before spawning new pipes
- Prevents pipes array from growing indefinitely

**Pipe Removal Behavior:**
- Pipes are removed when their right edge (x + PIPE_WIDTH) is less than 0
- Removal happens after pipes are moved left by PIPE_SPEED
- Reverse iteration prevents index issues when removing elements
- Empty pipes array is handled gracefully
- Memory is properly managed - pipes array doesn't grow unbounded

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added pipe removal logic in updatePipes() function

**Files Created:**
- tests/pipe-removal.test.js - 12 unit tests for pipe removal functionality

**Tests:** 12/12 passing (345 total across all test files)

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F019 (Create Collision Detection Function) is next - implement rectangle intersection detection
- The updatePipes() function now handles the full pipe lifecycle: movement, removal, and spawning
- Pipes are removed when fully off-screen to the left (right edge < 0)
- The reverse loop with splice() is the safe way to remove elements while iterating
- The pipes array will now maintain a reasonable size as pipes spawn and are removed

### [2026-01-10] - F019: Create Collision Detection Function
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Created checkCollision(rect1, rect2) function using AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) algorithm
- Function accepts two rectangle objects with {x, y, width, height} properties
- Returns true if rectangles overlap or touch, false otherwise
- Uses <= and >= comparisons to handle touching edges as collisions (appropriate for game physics)
- Function is commutative (order of arguments does not matter)
- Handles edge cases: zero width/height, negative positions, completely overlapping rectangles

**Collision Detection Algorithm:**
- Calculates right edge (x + width) and bottom edge (y + height) for both rectangles
- Checks if rectangles overlap in both x and y axes
- Two rectangles overlap if:
  - rect1's left edge is to the left of or equal to rect2's right edge AND
  - rect1's right edge is to the right of or equal to rect2's left edge AND
  - rect1's top edge is above or equal to rect2's bottom edge AND
  - rect1's bottom edge is below or equal to rect2's top edge

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added checkCollision() function

**Files Created:**
- tests/collision-detection.test.js - 22 unit tests for collision detection functionality

**Tests:** 22/22 passing (367 total across all test files)

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F020 (Implement Bird-Pipe Collision) is next - use checkCollision() to detect bird hitting pipes
- The checkCollision() function is ready to be used for bird-pipe collision detection
- Function handles touching edges as collisions, which is appropriate for game physics
- The function will be called in F020 to check bird against top and bottom pipe sections
- All edge cases are handled: zero dimensions, negative positions, complete overlap, etc.

### [2026-01-10] - F020: Implement Bird-Pipe Collision
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Created checkPipeCollisions() function that detects bird collisions with pipes
- Function creates bird hitbox from bird object properties (x, y, width, height)
- Loops through all pipes in the pipes array
- Creates hitbox for top pipe section (from y=0 to topHeight)
- Creates hitbox for bottom pipe section (from bottomY to ground)
- Uses checkCollision() function (from F019) to detect collisions
- Sets gameOver to true when bird collides with any pipe (top or bottom)
- Returns early after first collision is detected (optimization)
- Returns early if gameOver is already true (prevents unnecessary checks)
- Integrated checkPipeCollisions() into update() function after updatePipes()

**Collision Detection Behavior:**
- Bird hitting top pipe triggers game over
- Bird hitting bottom pipe triggers game over
- Bird passing through gap safely does not trigger game over
- Collision detection runs every frame during gameplay
- Multiple pipes are checked each frame
- Function stops checking after first collision is detected

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added checkPipeCollisions() function and integrated into update()

**Files Created:**
- tests/bird-pipe-collision.test.js - 20 unit tests for bird-pipe collision functionality

**Tests:** 20/20 passing (385 total across all test files)

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F021 (Add Score Variable and Display) is next - create score tracking and render on screen
- The checkPipeCollisions() function uses the checkCollision() function from F019
- Collision detection happens after pipes are moved (updatePipes) but before rendering
- The gameOver flag is set on pipe collision, which stops bird and pipe movement
- Bird can safely pass through the gap between top and bottom pipes without collision

### [2026-01-10] - F021: Add Score Variable and Display
**Status:** COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- Created score variable initialized to 0 in game state section
- Created renderScore() function that displays score as white text
- Score text is drawn at top center of canvas (x = CANVAS_WIDTH / 2, y = 20)
- Used large font size (48px sans-serif) for visibility
- Set textAlign to 'center' and textBaseline to 'top' for proper positioning
- Score is converted to string using toString() before rendering
- Added renderScore() call in render() function after renderGround()
- Score is reset to 0 in initBird() function for game reset functionality

**Visual Behavior:**
- Score displays as white text (#ffffff) at top center of canvas
- Text is clearly visible against sky blue background
- Score starts at 0 and displays every frame
- Font size of 48px ensures good visibility

**Files Modified:**
- game.js - Added score variable, renderScore() function, and integration into render()

**Files Created:**
- tests/score-display.test.js - 22 unit tests for score display functionality

**Tests:** 22/22 passing (407 total across all test files)

**Notes for Next Developer:**
- F022 (Detect Pipe Passing) is next - add logic to detect when bird passes through pipes
- The score variable is ready to be incremented when pipes are passed
- Score is reset to 0 in initBird() function, ready for game restart functionality
- The renderScore() function is called every frame in the render() function
- Score will need to be incremented in F023 (Increment Score on Pipe Pass)

**Verified:**
- Started local server on port 3000
- Navigated to http://localhost:3000 using Puppeteer
- Took screenshots of initial game state showing bird, ground, and score
- Verified game loads without console errors
- Confirmed ground collision stops the game (bird rests on ground when gameOver is true)
- Verified all 407 unit tests pass, including:
  - Pipe spawning tests (22 tests)
  - Pipe movement tests (17 tests)
  - Pipe removal tests (12 tests)
  - Bird-pipe collision tests (20 tests)
  - Ground collision tests (14 tests)
  - Ceiling collision tests (13 tests)

- Pipes spawn every 90 frames (PIPE_SPAWN_INTERVAL) when game is running
- Pipes move from right to left at 2 pixels per frame (PIPE_SPEED)
- Pipes are removed when they move completely off-screen to the left
- Bird-pipe collision detection works for both top and bottom pipe sections
- Ground collision detection works correctly
- All game mechanics verified through comprehensive unit test suite

**Browser Testing:**
- Game loads successfully without JavaScript errors
- Canvas renders correctly with bird, ground, and score visible
- Bird physics work (gravity, velocity, collision)
- Game over state triggers correctly on ground collision
