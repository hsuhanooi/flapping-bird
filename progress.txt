**Implemented:**
- Created index.html with HTML5 doctype and structure
- Added canvas element with id "gameCanvas" (400x600 dimensions)
- Linked to styles.css and game.js files
- Created placeholder styles.css and game.js files
- Fixed Jest configuration for Node.js 12 compatibility (downgraded from v29 to v27)
- Created 11 unit tests in tests/html-structure.test.js

**Files Created:**
- index.html - Main HTML structure with canvas

- game.js - Placeholder for game logic
- tests/html-structure.test.js - Unit tests for HTML structure

**Tests:** 11/11 passing

**Notes for Next Developer:**

- Added border to canvas for visibility during development
- Canvas displays as block element

**Files Modified:**
- styles.css - Complete CSS styling implementation

**Files Created:**
